        <li>The generated reports adhere to specified police reporting standards</li>
        <li>An API endpoint is created to receive transcription data and return generated reports</li>
        <li>Proper error handling and logging are implemented for the report generation process</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-4.4: Integrate Frontend with Report Generation API</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> police officer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> generate a report from my transcribed audio,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> I can quickly create standardized police reports.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A "Generate Report" button is added to the frontend interface</li>

        <li>A loading indicator is displayed while the report is being generated</li>
        <li>The generated report is displayed in a structured, readable format</li>
        <li>Error handling is implemented for failed API calls</li>
        <li>The user is notified of successful report generation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-4.5: Implement Report Editing and Formatting</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> police officer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> edit and format the generated report,<br>
