    <ul>
        <li>A series of prompts is created covering all aspects of a police report</li>
        <li>Prompts utilize context and output back-referencing as supported by MinimalChainable</li>
        <li>Prompts are designed to work effectively across different LLM models</li>
        <li>Prompts are tested with sample transcription data to ensure they produce desired outputs</li>
        <li>A document is created explaining the rationale behind each prompt in the series</li>
        <li>Prompts are reviewed and approved by a subject matter expert (if available)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-4.4: Implement Report Generation API Endpoint</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> implement an API endpoint for report generation using the Fusion Chain,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> the frontend can request report generation based on transcription data.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An API endpoint is created to receive transcription data and initiate report generation</li>
        <li>The endpoint triggers the Fusion Chain process with the provided transcription data</li>
        <li>The generated report is returned in a structured format (e.g., JSON)</li>
        <li>Proper error handling is implemented for various failure scenarios</li>
        <li>The API endpoint is documented with clear usage instructions and example requests/responses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-4.5: Integrate Frontend with Fusion Chain Report Generation API</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> police officer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> generate a report from my transcribed audio using the Fusion Chain,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> I can quickly create high-quality, standardized police reports.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A "Generate Report" button is added to the frontend interface</li>
        <li>Clicking the button sends the transcription data to the Fusion Chain report generation API</li>
        <li>A loading indicator is displayed while the report is being generated</li>
        <li>The generated report is displayed in a structured, readable format</li>
        <li>The frontend allows users to view outputs from different models in the Fusion Chain</li>
        <li>Error handling is implemented for failed API calls</li>
        <li>The user is notified of successful report generation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-4.6: Implement Report Editing and Formatting</h2>
