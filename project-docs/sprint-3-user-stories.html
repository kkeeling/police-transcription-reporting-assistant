        <li>Requirements are documented in a requirements.txt file</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.2: Implement Groq API Integration</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> integrate the Groq API for audio transcription,<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Groq API client is installed and configured in the backend environment</li>
        <li>API key is securely stored and managed (e.g., using environment variables)</li>
        <li>A wrapper function is created to handle Groq API calls for transcription</li>
        <li>The integration supports both audio file transcription and streaming audio transcription</li>
        <li>Error handling is implemented for API call failures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.3: Implement API Endpoint for Audio File Upload and Transcription</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> create an API endpoint for uploading audio files for transcription using Groq,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> users can transcribe pre-recorded audio files.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An endpoint for receiving audio file uploads is created</li>
        <li>The endpoint can handle common audio file formats supported by Groq (e.g., flac, mp3, mp4, wav)</li>
        <li>Uploaded files are properly validated for format and size</li>
        <li>The endpoint triggers the transcription process using the Groq API</li>
        <li>Transcription results are returned in a structured format</li>
        <li>Proper error handling is implemented for file upload and transcription processes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.4: Implement WebSocket Endpoint for Streaming Audio Transcription</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> create a WebSocket endpoint for streaming audio transcription using Groq,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> users can get real-time transcription of their speech.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A WebSocket endpoint is created for receiving streaming audio data</li>
        <li>The endpoint can handle real-time audio streams in a format supported by Groq</li>
        <li>Incoming audio stream is properly processed and sent to Groq API for transcription</li>
        <li>Transcription results are sent back to the client in real-time</li>
        <li>The WebSocket connection handles interruptions and reconnections gracefully</li>
        <li>Proper error handling is implemented for streaming and transcription processes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.5: Implement Health Check and API Documentation</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> implement a health check endpoint and generate API documentation,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> we can monitor the API's status and have clear documentation for all endpoints.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A health check endpoint is implemented to verify the API is running</li>
        <li>The health check returns appropriate status codes and basic system information</li>
        <li>API documentation is automatically generated using FastAPI's built-in tools</li>
        <li>Documentation includes clear descriptions of all endpoints, request/response formats, and example usage</li>
        <li>Documentation is easily accessible through a designated URL</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.6: Implement CORS and Security Measures</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> implement CORS and basic security measures,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> our application is secure and can properly handle cross-origin requests.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CORS is properly configured to allow requests from the frontend application</li>
        <li>Basic rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse</li>
        <li>Input validation is added to all API endpoints</li>
        <li>Security headers are properly set (e.g., X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options)</li>
        <li>Groq API key is securely stored and not exposed to the client</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.7: Create Initial Frontend-Backend Integration</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> create an initial integration between the frontend and backend,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> we can verify end-to-end communication for audio transcription using Groq.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Frontend is updated to send audio data to the backend endpoint for Groq transcription</li>
        <li>WebSocket connection is established from frontend for real-time audio streaming and transcription</li>
        <li>Transcription results from Groq are displayed in the frontend UI</li>
        <li>Error handling for failed API calls and WebSocket errors is implemented in the frontend</li>
        <li>Loading states are properly managed in the frontend during transcription</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-3.8: Begin Creating System and User Prompts for LLMs</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> start creating system and user prompts for our LLMs,<br>
    <strong>So that</strong> we can prepare for implementing the report generation feature.</p>
    <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Research is conducted on effective prompt engineering for police report generation</li>
        <li>Initial system prompts are drafted for the report generation LLM</li>
        <li>A template for user prompts is created, incorporating placeholders for transcription data</li>
        <li>A simple test harness is set up to evaluate prompt effectiveness with Ollama</li>
        <li>Documentation is started for the prompt engineering process and decisions</li>
    </ul>
