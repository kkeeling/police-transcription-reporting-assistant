    <h1>User Stories: Sprint 1 - Project Setup and Basic Frontend Structure</h1>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Docker deployment will be handled at the end of the project. The development environment will not use Docker to simplify the initial setup and development process.</p>

    <h2>US-1.1: Development Environment Setup</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
    <strong>I want to</strong> set up a local development environment for the frontend,<br>

        <li>A sample shadcn/ui component is added to the project to verify its integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>US-1.4: Basic Application Layout</h2>
    <p><strong>As a</strong> user,<br>
