**Narrative:**
On Thursday, August 10th, 2023, at approximately 0656 hours, Constable Larry FLUFFY, Badge 362, and Constable Justin ADAMS, Badge 779, were dispatched to the area behind the landmark at 1010 Dawson Road in regards to a weapons call in progress. Prior to their arrival, they were informed that a male complainant, later identified as Matthew Atum ACHNEEPINESKUM, had initially stated he was behind the Holiday Inn and had sustained a stab wound, and the accused was reportedly still in the vicinity.
However, before proceeding to the Holiday Inn, the Communications Department advised the officers that Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM was actually at his residence at 704 First Street. A ping of his cell phone confirmed its location in the area of 706 First Street.
At approximately 0710 hours, Constables FLUFFY and ERICK arrived at 706 First Street and spoke to Darren GORRELL, who stated he did not know why the officers were present and did not know Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM. The officers then knocked on the door of 704 First Street, where Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM answered.
Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM appeared intoxicated, exhibiting unsteady gait, slurred speech, and admitted to consuming alcohol that morning. He stated that the incident was a "very bad joke" intended for a TikTok video. He expressed remorse for his actions, apologized multiple times, and stated that he had already deleted the video from his social media feed.
Constable FLUFFY verified that Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM was not injured and did not require medical attention. He was advised that he could face charges of public mischief for providing false information to police. Despite this, he remained remorseful and apologized to the officers.
Constable FLUFFY exercised his discretion and did not lay criminal charges against Matthew ACHNEEPINESKUM. This report is filed solely for documentation purposes.
