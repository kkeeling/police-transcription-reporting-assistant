On July 15, 2023, at approximately 22:30 hours, I, Officer John SMITH (Badge #12345), responded to a noise complaint at 123 Oak Street, Thunder Bay. Upon arrival, I observed a large gathering of approximately 30-40 individuals in the backyard of the residence.

The complainant, identified as Jane DOE (DOB: 1980-05-15) of 125 Oak Street, reported that the loud music and shouting had been ongoing since 20:00 hours. Ms. DOE stated that she had attempted to speak with her neighbors about the noise but was ignored.

I made contact with the homeowner, Michael JOHNSON (DOB: 1985-09-22), who appeared to be intoxicated. Mr. JOHNSON was cooperative and agreed to end the party immediately. He was warned about the noise bylaw and potential consequences of future violations.

No arrests were made, and the gathering dispersed peacefully by 23:15 hours. Follow-up will be conducted in 48 hours to ensure compliance.

End of report.
